## What is REPL.IT?  
**Replit** is an online coding platform (aka *integrated development environment* (**IDE**)) that allows you to write, run, and collaborate on code from anywhere with an internet connection. With Replit, you don't need to worry about setting up your own development environment or installing software. Everything is done in the browser, so you can focus on coding.  This online coding platform supports over 50 languages and many programming courses use it, including [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

## Create your personal REPL.IT Account

Before you can start using the Repl.it programming environment in the cloud, you need to create a personal account.  
</br>
- **Sign In**

To get started, you will first need to go to the [Replit homepage](https://replit.com/). In the top right hand corner, click on [Sign Up](https://replit.com/signup).

</br>

## Create your first Repl

You may then create your **first Repl**, your *first read-eval-print-loop* programming environment by clicking on the top left hand corner **+ Create Repl**.  
Then you can choose from a list of templates **your preferred programming language** environment (e.g. *P5JS* for an easy to use Javascript library)

</br>

As a result, your selected coding environment will be setup as a single virtual machine, where you can handle programm files, edit and run programm code. An example of the coding environment for a P5JS template is given below

CodeSandbox is an online editor that helps you create web applications, from prototype to deployment. It allows developers to simply go to a URL in their browser to start building apps. This not only makes it easier to get started, it also makes it easier to share with your remote team or with your client to review the code or can be used for further development on these sandboxes by just sharing the URL. CodeSandbox is one such tool which supports npm dependencies and multiple files/directories. It allows us to show real-time feedback without any server communication because it runs everything on the browser.
</br>

### What you can do with Repl.It?
Now you got to know what the CodeSandbox is all about and now you get to know what you can do with it. As we all know that how daunting task will be to build JavaScript apps so that CodeSandbox team specifically focused on web application development to make the experience as smooth as possible. Just open your browser and start coding with React, Vue, Angular and Preact apps. With the click of button you can easily create your dream project it could be using React or Vue or Angular as it automates things like transpiling, bundling and dependency management for you. One of the best thing about this editor is that as and when you start typing code you can see a live preview so you know exactly whatâ€™s on with your app.
